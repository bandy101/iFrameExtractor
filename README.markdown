## Introduction ##

This project is forked from <https://github.com/lajos/iFrameExtractor>.


Why??

Just for the fun of it.

Some of you have been asking for this so :

The project has been updated to use our decoder framework

And audio has been added. Only audio queues without any decoding. of course you could just add a decode step or better yet change audio queues to audio units for even more format support.

We can help you with all of that.
